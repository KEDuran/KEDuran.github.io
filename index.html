								<h5 class="card-title">Bio</h5>
								<p class="card-text">
									My name is Krystal E. Duran, and I am an aspiring web
									developer. This portfolio site is my very first website, and
									despite its basic format, I am very proud of it! Here is a
									very short bio about me.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I grew up in a small border city named San Benito, Texas. I
									come from a medium sized family of six. I have three sisters
									and a loving Mom and Dad. I attended the University of Texas
									Pan American (now know as the University of Texas Rio Grande
									Valley) and earned a Bachelor in Political Science, Bachelor
									in Psychology, and a Master of Public Administration.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I met my wonderful husband, James, when I was 10 years old. We
									grew up in the same small city and went to school together.
									When we were both seniors in high school, I asked him to be my
									date to prom and its all history from there. We have been
									together for 12 years, and each of those years have been the
									best!! We currently live in Pflugerville, Texas in our first
									home that we bought in 2016.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									I firmly believe in giving back to community, so it is no
									surprise I found myself working in both the public and
									non-profit sector. I know government and advocacy services are
									not perfect, but I believe even the smallest gesture of
									kindness or contribution to society matters. I am currently
									employed as Business Operations Analyst for the Texas
									Association of School Boards, which is a non-profit
									organization that advocates for public schools. I come from a
									long line of educators so working for public school advocates
									proves the apple does not far fall from the tree.
								</p>
								<p class="card-text">
									Outside of working and doing a lot of homework for my bootcamp
									coding course, I love travelling, playing video games,
									reading, and doing jigsaw puzzles. Thank you for taking the
									time to read my brief bio! After I complete the coding
									bootcamp, I hope to make this portfolio website even better.
								</p>
